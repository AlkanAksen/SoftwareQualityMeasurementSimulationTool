# Software Quality Measurement Simulation Tool
## Project Description

The Software Quality Measurement Simulation Tool simulates the **ISO/IEC 15939 Measurement Process** and applies **ISO/IEC 25010** quality characteristics together with **ISO/IEC 25023** metrics.

The goal of the project is to transform **theoretical quality standards** into a **working software system** that can:

* Define quality goals
* Select quality characteristics
* Measure software quality using metrics
* Analyze and interpret quantitative results

---

## Project Scope

* Implementation of an ISO-based quality measurement process
* Standard-driven software design (not a static demo)
* Separation between **reference materials** and **actual program logic**
* Educational yet realistic software engineering approach

---

## Standards-Based Design

The software is designed according to the following standards:

| Standard      | Role in the Project                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ISO/IEC 15939 | Defines the measurement lifecycle implemented in the software |
| ISO/IEC 25010 | Provides quality characteristics and sub-characteristics      |
| ISO/IEC 25023 | Defines metrics and measurement concepts                      |

## Measurement Workflow Implemented

The program follows a structured workflow:

1. **Define**
   Define the evaluation context and quality goals.

2. **Plan**
   Assign importance weights to selected quality characteristics.

3. **Collect**
   Collect or simulate metric values based on standard definitions.

4. **Analyze**
   Calculate scores, identify gaps, and interpret results.

## Example Use Cases

* Evaluating a student portal
* Assessing an IoT system
* Analyzing a mobile application

These scenarios are **examples** and can be replaced with custom evaluation contexts.

---

## Repository Notes

* UI mockups and screenshots are included **for documentation purposes**
* They illustrate how the measurement process is visualized
* The actual software logic is **independent of these example files**

---

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a **software engineering / software quality course**.

Primary learning objectives:

* Applying ISO standards in real software design
* Bridging theory and implementation
* Practicing measurement-driven quality evaluation

---

## Disclaimer

This tool is a **simulation and educational project**.
It does not claim compliance certification and should not be used as an official audit tool.
